          <p>
            I was tasked to create a website that incorporated the use of lists and aggregators. I ended up choosing a
            sports card shop because of that is the intersection of my interest in sports and finance.

          <div class="body">
            <p>
              Before beginning, I chose to analyze three competitors (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="
              https://spotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/" target="_blank">Zillow</a>) and analyze which of their
              list/aggregation features that I liked and disliked. I aggregated my findings into the below chart.

            <p>
              Analysis: Amazon, Spotify, and Zillow all offer streamlined 'One Tap' functionalities for adding and accessing favorites, 
              yet they each tailor this feature to their platform's context. Amazon enriches the shopping experience with immediate feedback 
              via a pop-up and social sharing options, although it lacks filtering capabilities within favorites. Spotify facilitates content 
              management through various filtering options, essential for music lovers, and also allows for social sharing for users to present 
              their music taste to their friends. However, it fails to signal to users immediately where the playlist can be accessed, which can 
              be a pain point for new users. Zillow prioritizes efficiency with filtering features critical for real estate searches, yet it 
              misses opportunities for user reassurance and collaboration by not providing immediate action feedback or social sharing functionalities. 
              Each platform showcases a nuanced approach to UI design, focusing on the specific needs and behaviors of their user base while also 
              revealing distinct areas for potential enhancement.

          <h3>Personal Implementation</h3>
          <div class="body">
            <p>
              I will try to implement the following features:
              <div class="small-container">
                <div class="images-container">
                  <li> One Tap Add </li>
                  <li> One Tap Access </li>
                  <li> List Access Pop-Up On Add </li>
                </div>
                <div class="images-container">
                  <li> Filter Favorites </li>
                  <li>  Organization of Favorites (Descending) </li>
                </div>
              </div>
              However, the social sharing capability may be a bit outside of the scope of my technical ability. I think that would require an external database to maintain a shareable link.

          <h3>Idea</h3>
          <div class="body">
            <p>
              I decided on creating a sports cards shop that will allow users to browse sports cards and add them to cart. 
              The cards each contain the player image, name, sport, and price. Users can filter by sport (basketball, soccer, 
              baseball) and sort by player name (A-Z, Z-A) and price (low-high, high-low). There is a reset button available 
              for them to clear all filers and sorts. Each card will also have a 'like' button on it that users can tap to add 
              the player to cart, where the user's cart count + price total will be displayed.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Sketch</h3>
            <div class="body">
              <div class="images-container">
                <img src="./images/sketch.png" />
              </div>
              
              <p>The above is my sketch on how I wanted the layout of the site to look.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Deployment</h3>
            <div class="body">
              
              <div class="images-container">
                <figure class="image-with-label">
                  <img src="./images/site.png" alt="Deployed Sports Cards Shop Site"/>
                  <figcaption><a href="https://sports-cards-shop.vercel.app/" target="_blank">https://sports-cards-shop.vercel.app/</a></figcaption>
                </figure>
                
              </div>
              
              The above is what the final site looks like (coded in React and deployed on Vercel). I chose the background color of earth green and complement colors of 
              warm mustard yellow to match the retro vibe of the sports cards. I also used Courier New to mimic the retro typography
              font of the 1950's.

          <h3>A few thoughts...</h3>
          <div class="body">
            <li>
              When creating a site's feel, you have to do your research on the product (eg. retro)
            </li>
            <li>
              Small changes like capitalization, font family, and borders can greatly enhance the feel of your site
            </li>
            <li>
              I had a lot more fun then I thought I would creating this site. I think once you understand what you're aiming to build, 
              it's really fulfilling to bring the vision to life.
